#  Kobe Bryant Resigns from Lakers, Cites Unresolvable Dispute with Coaching Staff

In a move that surprises few, Kobe Bryant today announced his resignation from the Los Angeles Lakers. In an exclusive interview with ESPN, Bryant cited an unresolvable dispute with the coaching staff as the primary reason for his decision.

"I can't keep going through the same thing over and over again," said Bryant. "The coaching staff hasn't been able to put together a game plan that allows me to be successful. It's just not worth it anymore."

Bryant also denied rumors that he was planning to retire at the end of this season. "I still have some good years left in me," he said. "I'm just not sure if I want to spend them with the Lakers."

This is the second time in Bryant's career that he has left the Lakers. He spent eight seasons with the team before joining the Golden State Warriors prior to the 2004-05 season.

The Lakers released a statement saying they were "disappointed" by Bryant's decision but wished him well in his future endeavors.

"It's a new challenge for me," Bryant told Yahoo Sports. "I'm excited about it."

Rondo, 28, is coming off an All-Star season in which he averaged 11.7 points and 11.1 assists per game. The Celtics will rebuild around him and the two first-round picks they acquired from the Lakers.

Bryant is third all time on the NBA's scoring list with 33,643 points. He was named MVP of the 2007-08 NBA Finals when the Celtics beat the Lakers in six games.

#  Philadelphia 76ers Acquire Kobe Bryant in Exchange for Future Draft Picks

The Philadelphia 76ers have acquired Kobe Bryant from the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for future draft picks, according to league sources.

Bryant, who is in the final year of his contract with the Lakers, was rumored to be on the trading block for some time now. The 36-year-old shooting guard has been hampered by injuries over the past few seasons and is no longer a part of the Lakers' long-term plans.

The Sixers are getting a future Hall of Famer in Kobe Bryant and they are excited to add him to their roster. "Kobe is one of the greatest players of all time and we're thrilled to have him join our team," said Sixers general manager Sam Hinkie. "He brings a lot of experience and leadership to our locker room and we're excited to see what he can do in a Sixers uniform."

This deal came as a surprise to many because the Lakers were not expected to trade Bryant this season. But with the young core they have in place, they felt it was best to move him now while they could still get something in return.

For Kobe Bryant, this is an opportunity to play for a playoff contender and compete for a championship. He's looking forward to helping the Sixers make a deep run in the playoffs. "I'm excited about joining the Sixers and help them contend for a championship," said Bryant. "Philly has some great players and I'm looking forward to playing with them."
