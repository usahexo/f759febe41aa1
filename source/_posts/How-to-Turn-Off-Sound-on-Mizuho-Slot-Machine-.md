#  How to Mute Sound on Mizuho Slot Machine 

The Mizuho slot machine is a popular choice for casino-goers, but the sound it emits can be quite loud. If you’re looking to mute the sound on this particular machine, there are a few things you can do. 

First and foremost, if you’re in a casino, speak to a floor attendant. Many casinos have machines that allow you to mute the sound directly from the machine itself. 

If you’re not in a casino, or there is no mute button on the machine itself, your next best bet is to try and find the sound settings on your device. On an iPhone or iPad, for example, go to Settings > Sounds > and change the Ringer And Alerts slider to mute. 

If you’re using headphones with your device, make sure they’re plugged in all the way. Also check that the volume isn’t turned down all the way or turned off. To do this on an iPhone or iPad, go to Settings > Music > and make sure Sound Check is turned off (if it’s on) and that both Show Apple Music and Show Volume Control are turned on (if they aren’t already). 

Finally, if none of these tips work for you, there is always the old fashioned way of putting something in your ear to block out the sound!
