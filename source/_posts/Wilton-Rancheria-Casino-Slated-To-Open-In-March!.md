#  New Casino Slated To Open In March, But Will It Benefit The Local Economy?

It was announced this week that a new casino is set to open in the city in March. The $350 million development will create over 1,000 jobs, but some local business owners are not convinced that it will be good for the economy.

"I don't think it's going to be beneficial at all," said one restaurant owner. "The casino is going to draw business away from us and there's nothing we can do about it."

Others are more optimistic, believing that the influx of new casino-goers will help to boost tourism and spending in the city. "I'm excited for it," said one local resident. "It's going to bring in a lot of money and create a lot of jobs. I think it will be great for the economy."

The new casino is expected to attract millions of visitors each year, so the jury is still out on whether or not it will be good for the city as a whole. Only time will tell!
