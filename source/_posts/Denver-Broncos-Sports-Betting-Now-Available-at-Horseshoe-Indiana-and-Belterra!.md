#  Horseshoe Indiana and Belterra Eyeing Sports Betting Launch for Denver Broncos Games

The horseshoe Indiana and Belterra casino resorts are preparing to offer sports betting on Denver Broncos games as the National Football League (NFL) season kicks off this week. The move will make the two properties the only ones in the state of Indiana to offer such gambling services.

The horseshoe has already created a special “Denver Broncos” section on its website, which is now live. Bettors there can place wagers on straight bets, point spreads, totals, and moneylines for all of the team’s upcoming games. In addition, the horseshoe plans to offer in-game betting for select matchups throughout the season.

Belterra has not yet announced its full sports betting lineup, but it is expected to mirror that of the horseshoe. Both casinos are owned by Delaware North, a gaming and hospitality company with properties in several states.

Indiana specifically legalized sports betting in May of this year, following the repeal of a federal ban that had been in place since 1992. It joins several other states that have moved to allow sports wagering in recent months, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi.

While exact figures are not available, it is estimated that between $150 billion and $400 billion is wagered on sports each year in the United States illegally. The new legalization efforts are seen as a way to capture some of that money and generate additional tax revenue for states.
