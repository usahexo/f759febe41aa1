#  Benfica crowned Liga Nos champions!

After a hard-fought season, Benfica have been crowned Liga Nos champions, ahead of Porto and Sporting CP.

Although they started the season slowly, with just two wins from their first six games, Benfica turned things around in spectacular fashion. They went on an incredible unbeaten run of 34 games – a new Liga Nos record – to clinch the title with two games to spare.

Their decisive victory came last weekend, when they beat Feirense 3-1 to open up an unassailable eight-point lead at the top of the table. This was their fifth league title in the last six seasons and their 36th overall.

Benfica’s success this season has been built on a rock-solid defence. They have conceded just 19 goals in 34 games, the best record in the division. Captain Luisão has led by example at the back, while young striker Jonas has been in lethal form up front, scoring 27 goals in all competitions.

Manager Rui Vitoria will be hoping to continue his team’s impressive form next season as they look to win their first Champions League trophy.

#  Porto relegated to Liga Nos relegation zone!

Portugal's Primeira Liga relegation strugglers, Porto, have been relegated to the Liga Nos relegation zone after their 3-1 home loss against Benfica on Sunday.

The result sees Porto drop to 18th in the table, one point behind 17th-placed Feirense and two points behind Estoril, who are currently in the relegation play-off spot.

It is a sad day for Porto fans, who now face an anxious wait to see whether their club will be relegated to the second division for the first time in their history.

Luis Castro's side were comprehensively beaten by Benfica on Sunday, with Jonas scoring twice and Pizzi adding a third goal for the visitors.

Porto did get a consolation goal through Vincent Aboubakar in stoppage time, but it was not enough to prevent them from sliding down the table.

The club's owners will now be under pressure to invest in new players during the January transfer window in order to keep them in the top flight.

#  Sporting CP clinch European football for next season!

Sporting CP are a Portuguese football club who, on Wednesday evening, secured their place in next season’s Europa League following a 3-1 victory over Belenenses. They now join the likes of Atletico Madrid, FC Barcelona and Chelsea in Europe’s elite competition.

This was an important win for Jorge Jesus’ side, especially as they had lost their previous two matches in all competitions. The result also means that Sporting CP will finish in fourth place in the Primeira Liga.

It was Felipe Pardo who got the ball rolling for Sporting CP midway through the first half, firing them into a 1-0 lead. The Colombian then doubled his side’s advantage after the break with a superb curling effort.

Belenenses did pull one back through substitute Bruno Cunha but it was not enough to prevent Sporting CP from securing their spot in next season’s Europa League.

#  Braga and Boavista relegated from Liga Nos!

Two of Portugal's biggest clubs, Braga and Boavista, were relegated from Liga Nos on the final day of the season.

Boavista finished in 19th place, while Braga ended up in 18th. Both clubs failed to win any of their final 10 games of the campaign.

It is the first time that either club has been relegated from Portugal's top flight.

Braga had been in Liga Nos since 2009, while Boavista returned to the top flight in 2013.

#  More top-flight mayhem as FC Famalicão promoted to Liga Nos

In a season of incredible surprises in Portugal’s top flight, FC Famalicão can now be added to the list of clubs making an unexpected ascent to the Liga Nos.

Famalicão’s promotion was confirmed on Sunday as they downed Boavista 2-1, a result that saw them leapfrog their opponents into second place in the Primeira Liga standings. While they may have been expected to compete for a top-six spot at best, few could have foreseen them ultimately claiming one of the four promotion places.

The Northeastern side were led by a goalscoring header from João Alves, who put them 1-0 up after just six minutes, before Wilson Eduardo doubled their advantage shortly before the hour mark. boavista did pull one back through Matheusinho late on, but it was nothing more than a consolation and Famalicão held on for all three points.

This success marks the club’s return to Portugal’s top division for the first time since being relegated in 2011-12. They had last played in Liga Nos during 2007-08 – also their only previous season in the competition.

There have been plenty of shocks already this season in Liga Nos, with newly promoted FC Arouca and Sporting Braga both currently occupying top spot in the table. Now Famalicão join them as one of Portugal’s ‘new boys’ looking to make an impact in the country’s top flight.
