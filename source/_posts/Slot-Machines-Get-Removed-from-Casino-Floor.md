#  Slot Machines Get Removed from Casino Floor

Slot machines are being removed from the casino floor and placed in a dedicated area, as announced by the Gambling Commission. The new area will have more stringent rules for how much people can spend and how long they can play for.

The decision comes as part of a package of new measures from the government to protect problem gamblers. It is hoped that these measures will help to address the £2bn lost each year due to gambling addiction.

Slot machines have been identified as one of the biggest contributors to problem gambling, with around two-thirds of problem gamblers spending money on them. Minister for Sport and Civil Society Tracey Crouch said: "We know that slot machines can be particularly addictive and we are committed to doing everything we can to protect people from becoming addicted."

The new area will have a lower betting limit than the rest of the casino, with players only able to bet £2 per spin rather than £100. There will also be a time limit on how long people can play for, with players only able to spend up to four hours in the area each day.

The changes come into effect on 1 April 2019 and will apply to all licensed casinos in England and Wales.
