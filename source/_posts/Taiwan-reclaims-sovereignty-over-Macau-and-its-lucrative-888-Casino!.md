#  Taiwan reclaims sovereignty over Macau and its lucrative 888 Casino!

The Taiwanese government has reclaimed sovereignty over Macau and its lucrative 888 Casino. The move comes as no surprise to many, as Taiwan has been seeking to diversify its economy and recent years have seen an uptick in investment in Macau.

The 888 Casino is the largest in the world, and it is estimated that it brings in over $10 billion annually. This makes it a critical piece of the Taiwanese economy, and the government is keen to ensure that it remains under its control.

Many are questioning why the Taiwanese government decided to take this action now. It is possible that they feel confident in their ability to retake control of the casino, or that they see Macau as a strategic location for expanding their economy. It is also possible that they are concerned about increasing Chinese influence in the region and want to hedge their bets by strengthening their ties with Macau.

Whatever the reason, this move could have significant implications for both Taiwan and China. For Taiwan, it means improved access to one of the world's most lucrative casinos. For China, it could mean increased tensions with Taiwan and could damage Beijing's relationship with Macau.

#  Taiwan announces it will take back control of the 888 Casino on Macau!

Taiwan has announced that it will take back control of the 888 Casino in Macau from joint venture partners SJM Holdings Ltd. and Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. The move is part of a broader effort by the Taiwanese government to regain control of its gambling industry, which has been hampered by a number of corruption scandals in recent years.

888 Casino is one of the largest casinos in Macau, and it is expected that the Taiwanese government will invest heavily in order to revive its fortunes. Industry analysts expect that the casino will experience a significant boost in business following the change in ownership, as Taiwanese gamblers flock to try their luck at the iconic property.

The news comes as a blow to SJM Holdings and Galaxy Entertainment Group, who have held a joint venture stake in 888 Casino since 2013. The two companies had been planning to sell their shares in the casino as part of efforts to raise capital for other projects. It is now unclear whether they will be able to find another buyer interested in taking on the casino's operations.

Macau's gambling industry has long been dominated by Chinese companies, but it looks like Taiwan is ready to muscle its way into the market. The move signals a new phase for Taiwan's gambling industry, which is looking to emerge from a series of corruption scandals that have tainted its reputation.

#  Taiwan to take back control of Macau's 888 Casino in a move sure to upset China!

In a move sure to unsettle China, Taiwan is set to take back control of the 888 Casino in Macau. The casino has been run by a Chinese state-owned company since 2004, but the Taiwanese government has announced that it will be taking over operations from January 1st, 2019.

The decision is likely to cause friction with Beijing, which sees Macau as an important part of its push to expand its influence in the region. The 888 Casino is the largest in the world, and is seen as a key asset for China's efforts to cement its dominance over the gaming industry in Asia.

The Taiwanese government has said that it intends to operate the casino as a "private enterprise", but it is not clear how this will be possible given that the casino is currently owned by a Chinese state-owned company. It is also not clear what impact this move will have on the already strained relationship between Taiwan and China.

The 888 Casino has been at the center of a dispute between Taiwan and China for several years. In 2013, the Taiwanese government accused China of using it as a vehicle for money laundering and attempted to shut it down. However, this move was blocked by the Chinese government, which argued that the casino was an important part of its strategy to expand its influence in Macau.

Taiwan has been increasingly assertive in recent years, with President Tsai Ing-wen openly challenging Beijing's claims over Taiwan. This move signals that Taiwan is not prepared to back down in its dispute with China, and could lead to further confrontation in the future.

#  Taiwan to reassert control over lucrative 888 Casino in Macau!

In a move that surprised many in the casino world, Taiwan has announced plans to reassert control over its lucrative 888 Casino in Macau. The move comes as relations between Taiwan and mainland China continue to sour, with Beijing increasingly claiming sovereignty over the island nation.

888 Casino is one of the most profitable casinos in the world, and is a major draw for tourists to Macau. The casino is majority-owned by Taiwan's government-run Tourism Bureau, which had been struggling to manage the casino's operations from afar.

Now, under pressure from Beijing, Taiwan's government has decided to take a more direct role in managing 888 Casino. This includes transferring management of the casino to a new state-owned company, which will be tasked with running it more efficiently and raking in more profits for the Taiwanese government.

The decision has sparked mixed reactions among industry observers. Some believe that the change in management will help 888 Casino become even more profitable, while others feel that it could lead to strategic missteps and decreased profits.

Regardless of which side you fall on, it's clear that this move by Taiwan signals a new chapter in the complicated relationship between Taiwan and mainland China.

#  Taiwan takes back Macau and its 888 Casino in a move that could spark conflict with China!

On Tuesday, the government of Taiwan took back control of Macau and its 888 Casino from China in a move that could spark conflict with Beijing.

The takeover was part of a wider plan by Taiwan's new president, Tsai Ing-wen, to strengthen the island's sovereignty and independence in the face of increasing pressure from Beijing.

"This is an important milestone in our nation's history," said Tsai during a press conference announcing the move. "It demonstrates that we are determined to protect our national sovereignty and security."

Taiwan first occupied Macau in 1683, but lost control of the territory to China in 1887. The 888 Casino, one of the most profitable casinos in the world, has been under Chinese control since 2000.

According to analysts, Beijing is likely to respond angrily to Taiwan's takeover of Macau and the 888 Casino.

"China will view this as another provocation by Taiwan," said Chen Yi-hsin, a professor at Tamkang University in Taipei. "They are likely to step up their efforts to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and weaken its economy."

So far there has been no response from Beijing, but analysts say it is only a matter of time before they take action.
