There are four possible outcomes in blackjack:

1. You win

2. The dealer wins

3. You tie (push)

4. You lose





  In blackjack, the aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over. If your hand equals or exceeds the dealers hand, you win. If your hand is lower than the dealers, you lose.  Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what makes a better hand. Other cards are face value.  In blackjack, if both you and the dealer have the same point total (e.g. 16), this is called a push and your bet is returned to you.  Blackjack pays 3:2 which means that for every $5 you bet, you receive $7.50 back (assuming you win). This is why basic strategy recommends always hitting on 16 against a dealer’s 10, for example – it’s mathematically the most profitable move assuming you make no other mistakes elsewhere in your decision making process.  There are a number of different rules variations found in different casinos around the world, but the following are some of the more common ones:  Doubling Down: When you double down, you are allowed to increase your wager by 100% and receive just one more card. This is often done when your first two cards add up to nine, 10 or 11, since this gives you a good chance of getting closer to 21 without going bust (going over 21). Splitting Pairs: When your first two cards are of the same rank (e.g. two kings), you can choose to split them into two separate hands, doubling your bet in the process (but still only receiving one more card per hand). This strategy can be profitable when the dealer is showing a low card, since they are then likely to bust with any additional cards drawn. Insurance: If the dealers first card is an ace, players can take insurance – which is effectively a side bet that pays 2:1 if the dealer has blackjack (a hand totalling 21 points).  Most casinos will allow players to double down on their insurance bets too, which increases the potential pay-out from 2:1 to 4:1 if the dealers second card happens to be a ten value card and results in them having blackjack.(Insurance typically costs half of what your original bet was.) Surrendering: A player may also choose to surrender half their bet and end the game at any time – regardless of whether they have been winning or losing up– providing the casino allows it. This option should only be chosen when it’s clear that continuing will lead to almost certain defeat anyway.(Some casinos do not permit early surrender; others allow it only after dealer draws first Ace.)
