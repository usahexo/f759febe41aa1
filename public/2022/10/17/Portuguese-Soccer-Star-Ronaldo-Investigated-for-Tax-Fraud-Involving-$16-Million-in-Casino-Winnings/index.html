The allegations involve money earned by Ronaldo through winnings at casinos in the country. While Ronaldo has denied any wrongdoing, Spanish authorities are said to have evidence that he failed to declare income from his casino winnings between 2011 and 2014.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Ronaldo has been in the public eye for less-than-savory reasons. In addition to previous allegations of tax fraud, he was also involved in a high-profile custody battle with his former girlfriend over their young son. If convicted of tax fraud in this case, Ronaldo could face up to five years in prison and a hefty fine.</p>
<p>This latest development is sure to add to the growing chorus of critics who contend that professional soccer players are overpaid and engage in behavior that is detrimental to the sport’s image. Indeed, many people feel that Ronaldo’s alleged actions are particularly egregious given that he is one of the highest-paid players in the world. His $93 million salary last year made him the second-highest earning athlete behind only Floyd Mayweather Jr.</p>
<p>For his part, Ronaldo has taken to social media to proclaim his innocence, stating “I always try to comply with the law, taxation and football regulations.” He also vowed to fight any charges levied against him “to the end.” Whether or not he is ultimately found guilty remains to be seen, but this latest controversy is sure to tarnish his image and further detract from the already diminished reputation of professional soccer.</p>

Money-Laundering Case"></a>Prosecutor Seeks to Recover $7.8 Million from Deutsche Bank in 888 Holdings Ltd. Money-Laundering Case</h1><p>Prosecutor seeks to recover $7.8 million from Deutsche Bank in 888 Holdings Ltd. money-laundering case.</p>
<p>The prosecutor’s office filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Bank on Thursday, seeking to recover 7.8 million euros ($8.8 million) it says was laundered through 888 Holdings Ltd., a Gibraltar-based online gambling company.</p>
<p>888 Holdings was among several companies named in a 2016 money-laundering indictment filed by the prosecutor against 15 people and two companies accused of using Netherlands-based call centers to scam millions of euros from victims in Spain.</p>
<p>A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman said the bank couldn’t comment on pending litigation.</p>
<p>In its complaint, the prosecutor says Deutsche Bank handled more than 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in transactions for 888 Holdings between January 2012 and June 2014, including “a high number of suspicious transactions.”</p>
<p>Investigators say the defendants used the money from the scam to buy cars, yachts and other luxury items.</p>

The court ruled that the funds would be released to repay debts to Playtech, the casino’s parent company.</p>
<p>The dispute between 888 Casino and Playtech began in October, when 888 Casino stopped making payments to Playtech. In November, Playtech sued 888 Casino for failing to make debt payments worth $27 million. The Gibraltar court’s ruling on Monday ordered 888 Casino to repay those debts.</p>
<p>888 Casino has not yet commented on the court’s ruling.</p>

<p>The Gambling Commission said 888 had breached its license conditions by not protecting vulnerable customers and had failed to take adequate steps to prevent money laundering.</p>
<p>In a statement, the commission’s executive director, Richard Watson, said: “This case is about people being badly let down by a business which failed to keep them safe.</p>
<p>“888 let down some of the most vulnerable people in society and today’s fine reflects that appalling failure.”</p>
<p>The commission said it had also imposed a condition on 888’s license that required the company to improve its anti-money laundering and social responsibility practices.</p>
<p>888 Holdings issued a statement saying it accepted the regulator’s findings and was committed to “driving industry standards higher.” It also promised to make improvements to its customer protection policies.</p>
