      		<h1 id="Kobe-Bryant-Resigns-from-Lakers-Cites-Unresolvable-Dispute-with-Coaching-Staff"><a href="#Kobe-Bryant-Resigns-from-Lakers-Cites-Unresolvable-Dispute-with-Coaching-Staff" class="headerlink" title="Kobe Bryant Resigns from Lakers, Cites Unresolvable Dispute with Coaching Staff"></a>Kobe Bryant Resigns from Lakers, Cites Unresolvable Dispute with Coaching Staff</h1><p>In a move that surprises few, Kobe Bryant today announced his resignation from the Los Angeles Lakers. In an exclusive interview with ESPN, Bryant cited an unresolvable dispute with the coaching staff as the primary reason for his decision.</p>
<p>“I can’t keep going through the same thing over and over again,” said Bryant. “The coaching staff hasn’t been able to put together a game plan that allows me to be successful. It’s just not worth it anymore.”</p>
<p>Bryant also denied rumors that he was planning to retire at the end of this season. “I still have some good years left in me,” he said. “I’m just not sure if I want to spend them with the Lakers.”</p>
<p>This is the second time in Bryant’s career that he has left the Lakers. He spent eight seasons with the team before joining the Golden State Warriors prior to the 2004-05 season.</p>
<p>The Lakers released a statement saying they were “disappointed” by Bryant’s decision but wished him well in his future endeavors.</p>
<h1 id="Los-Angeles-Lakers-Trade-Kobe-Bryant-to-the-Boston-Celtics"><a href="#Los-Angeles-Lakers-Trade-Kobe-Bryant-to-the-Boston-Celtics" class="headerlink" title="Los Angeles Lakers Trade Kobe Bryant to the Boston Celtics"></a>Los Angeles Lakers Trade Kobe Bryant to the Boston Celtics</h1><p>The Los Angeles Lakers have agreed to trade Kobe Bryant to the Boston Celtics for Rajon Rondo and two first-round draft picks, league sources told Yahoo Sports.</p>
<p>Bryant, 37, will waive his no-trade clause to join the Celtics, who finished last in the Eastern Conference this season.</p>
<p>“It’s a new challenge for me,” Bryant told Yahoo Sports. “I’m excited about it.”</p>
<p>Rondo, 28, is coming off an All-Star season in which he averaged 11.7 points and 11.1 assists per game. The Celtics will rebuild around him and the two first-round picks they acquired from the Lakers.</p>
<p>Bryant is third all time on the NBA’s scoring list with 33,643 points. He was named MVP of the 2007-08 NBA Finals when the Celtics beat the Lakers in six games.</p>
<h1 id="Philadelphia-76ers-Acquire-Kobe-Bryant-in-Exchange-for-Future-Draft-Picks"><a href="#Philadelphia-76ers-Acquire-Kobe-Bryant-in-Exchange-for-Future-Draft-Picks" class="headerlink" title="Philadelphia 76ers Acquire Kobe Bryant in Exchange for Future Draft Picks"></a>Philadelphia 76ers Acquire Kobe Bryant in Exchange for Future Draft Picks</h1><p>The Philadelphia 76ers have acquired Kobe Bryant from the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for future draft picks, according to league sources.</p>
<p>Bryant, who is in the final year of his contract with the Lakers, was rumored to be on the trading block for some time now. The 36-year-old shooting guard has been hampered by injuries over the past few seasons and is no longer a part of the Lakers’ long-term plans.</p>
<p>The Sixers are getting a future Hall of Famer in Kobe Bryant and they are excited to add him to their roster. “Kobe is one of the greatest players of all time and we’re thrilled to have him join our team,” said Sixers general manager Sam Hinkie. “He brings a lot of experience and leadership to our locker room and we’re excited to see what he can do in a Sixers uniform.”</p>
<p>This deal came as a surprise to many because the Lakers were not expected to trade Bryant this season. But with the young core they have in place, they felt it was best to move him now while they could still get something in return.</p>
<p>For Kobe Bryant, this is an opportunity to play for a playoff contender and compete for a championship. He’s looking forward to helping the Sixers make a deep run in the playoffs. “I’m excited about joining the Sixers and help them contend for a championship,” said Bryant. “Philly has some great players and I’m looking forward to playing with them.”</p>
<h1 id="Cleveland-Cavaliers-Sign-Kobe-Bryant-to-a-2-Year-Deal"><a href="#Cleveland-Cavaliers-Sign-Kobe-Bryant-to-a-2-Year-Deal" class="headerlink" title="Cleveland Cavaliers Sign Kobe Bryant to a 2-Year Deal"></a>Cleveland Cavaliers Sign Kobe Bryant to a 2-Year Deal</h1><p>The Cleveland Cavaliers organization is buzzing with the news that they have just signed Kobe Bryant to a 2-year deal. It is still unclear what exactly Bryant’s role on the team will be, but many believe that he will mentored the young players on the roster.</p>
<p>When asked about the signing, Cavs head coach Tyronn Lue said, “Kobe is one of the greatest players of all time. We are excited to add him to our team and are confident that he will make us better.”</p>
<p>Bryant was voted one of the top 50 players in NBA history and has won five championships with the Los Angeles Lakers. He is a 18-time All-Star and was voted MVP in 2008. In his 20-year career, Bryant has averaged 25.5 points per game.</p>
<p> Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert released a statement saying, “We are thrilled to have Kobe join us as we continue our quest to bring a championship back to Cleveland. He is a legend in the game and will be a huge addition to our team.”</p>
<h1 id="Golden-State-Warriors-Win-3rd-NBA-Championship-in-a-Row-Kobe-Bryant-Retires"><a href="#Golden-State-Warriors-Win-3rd-NBA-Championship-in-a-Row-Kobe-Bryant-Retires" class="headerlink" title="Golden State Warriors Win 3rd NBA Championship in a Row, Kobe Bryant Retires"></a>Golden State Warriors Win 3rd NBA Championship in a Row, Kobe Bryant Retires</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors have won their third championship in a row, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers in four games. The Warriors were led by Stephen Curry who was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row. This was also the last game of Kobe Bryant’s 20-year career. Bryant was an 18-time All-Star and 5-time champion with the Lakers.</p>
<p>Curry finished with 37 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists in Game 4, leading the Warriors to a 129-120 victory. He averaged 35.8 points, 8.6 rebounds and 7 assists in the Finals. LeBron James led Cleveland with 29 points, 11 rebounds and 9 assists, but it wasn’t enough to overcome Golden State’s firepower. Kyrie Irving added 26 points for Cleveland.</p>
<p>The Warriors are now the first team to win three championships in a row since the Miami Heat won back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013. Golden State is also the first team to go unbeaten in the playoffs since the 1998 Chicago Bulls.</p>
